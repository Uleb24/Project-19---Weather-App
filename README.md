# Portfolio 1---Weather-App
This is my first official portfolio entry, which is a working weather app.

The weather app itself doesn't have a lot of information, which could be further added, such as the wind speed and etc. but it has the basic info any weather app should have !

API and data was gathered from OpenWeatherMap.

I will use this project as a basis for my other portfolio projects which are real and working, long projects.
